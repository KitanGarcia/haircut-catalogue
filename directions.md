### Programming Assignment: Haircut Catalogue Website with Local Database

#### Objective

Develop a simple web application that serves as a catalogue for different haircuts. The application should have a frontend displaying various haircuts and a backend with a local database. Implement a search functionality to allow users to search haircuts by their names.

#### Requirements

##### 1. Backend

Language*: Use Python or Node.js for the backend.
Framework*: You may choose between Flask (Python), Express (Node.js), or any other suitable backend framework.
Database\*: Implement a local database (SQLite, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB) to store haircut data. Each entry should contain at least the following fields: `id`, `name`, `description`, `imageURL`.

##### 2. Frontend

Technology*: Use React, Angular, or Vue.js to create the frontend.
Display*: The main page should display a gallery of haircuts. Each haircut item should show its name, a brief description, and an image.
Search Functionality\*: Implement a search bar to filter haircuts by name. The search should be performed on the server side.

##### 3. UI/UX Design

The design should be responsive and user-friendly.
Ensure the application is visually appealing and easy to navigate.

##### 4. Testing

Write unit tests for both backend and frontend code.
Include instructions on how to run the tests in your documentation.

#### Deliverables

Source code for both backend and frontend.
A `README.md` file with:
Setup and installation instructions.
Instructions on how to run the application and tests.
Any necessary scripts for database setup or dummy data generation.

#### Evaluation Criteria

Functionality*: The application works as described.
Code Quality*: Clean, readable, and well-structured code.
Design and UX*: Aesthetics and ease of use of the interface.
Error Handling*: Appropriate handling and reporting of errors.
Documentation*: Clarity and completeness of the documentation.
Testing*: Adequacy and quality of unit tests.

#### Bonus Points

Implement additional features like sorting by different criteria or user ratings for haircuts.
Demonstrate use of advanced database querying (e.g., full-text search).
Showcase creative UI/UX features or animations.

#### Submission Guidelines

Host the source code on a public Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.).
Ensure the application is easy to set up and run on a different machine.
Provide any necessary environment variables or configuration files in a `.env.example` or `config.example` file (excluding sensitive information).
This assignment is designed to assess your coding skills as well as your ability to create a complete, user-friendly application. We encourage creativity and thoughtful design. Good luck!
